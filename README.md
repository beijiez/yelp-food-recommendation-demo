## Demo notes: HowTo Setup from scratch

```bash
# James: "Hello everyone! Today, we'll be building a full-stack web application live. We'll use Node.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and GitHub Copilot as our coding assistant to help streamline the development process. In the first half, I'll take on the role of the customer and Beijie will build out the application prototype, while I give requirements and feedback. In the second half, we'll switch roles â€” I will enhance the prototype by adding additional feature, but more on that later. OK, let's get started"

# James: "Everyday, I seem to have trouble deciding what to eat for lunch. I want an app that can recommend me some restaurants based on my location and cuisine preference. Can you build that for me?"
# Beijie: "yes of course. I am hungry as well. let's do it"
# Make project directory
mkdir client server
```

```bash
cd server
npm install express cors axios dotenv
touch index.js
# edit index.js, use copilot to "Generate a API to call GET on yelp business API to retrieve a list of restaurants given input of 
# location, cuisine, and limit. Show restaurant name, rating, price, and url. Make sure to handle CORS"
node index.js
```

```bash
# Open new terminal
cd client
npx create-react-app .
# In index.js, comment out two reportWebVitals() and 
#   import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
npm install axios
# edit App.js, use copilot to "generate a form that takes in location, cuisine, and limit
# make sure it gets from the server api /restaurants and serving port 3000
# Restaurant output should have name, rating, price ($), and url"
npm start
Y
```

```bash
# Demo the app
# Beijie: "I think that is our prototype for this restaurant web service. How does this look James? And questions comments before I pass it over to James?"
# "push to git", pass to James
```

```bash
# Beijie: "Now we will swap roles, I will be the customer, while James will add more features to the app"
# Beijie: "I want validation added to the app such that if the user tries to submit while leaving cuisine, location, or limit empty, an error shows that they're missing it."
```
```bash
cd server
# select 'validator.js'
# prompt: "Create a validator class that satisfies the requirements: cuisine, location, and limit are required. limit must be an integer. Then, show me how to integrate it into my server code."
```
```bash
cd client
# select 'App.js'
# prompt: "Modify this code to surface the error message from the server side validator at the bottom of the page and in red text."
# demonstrate changes in app
cd server 
npm i
node index.js
cd ../client
npm i
npm start
```
```bash
cd server
# select 'tests/validator.test.js'
# prompt: "Generate some unit tests for the Validator class."
npm i jest --save-dev
add npm test script to package.json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
}
npm test
```
```bash
# select 'validator.js'
# break it (remove an 'if' block) & re-run tests
# prompt: "My tests are failing. How should I fix my code?"
npm test
# Now our tests are all passing again
```
```bash
# Beijie: "Great! Can we talk about how we would deploy this app to the cloud? Perhaps with a Terraform template? Can you help me with that?"
# Go to Copilot Edits, select files
# prompt: "Generate terraform that uses the Azure provider to deploy this project as a webapp, and show me what commands i would run to execute the terraform, bundle my app, and deploy to those Azure resources"
```
```bash
Bejie: "Can we add a README so others know how this works?"
# create README
# try autocomplete with copilot (fails)
# try generating README with project file context (success)
```
